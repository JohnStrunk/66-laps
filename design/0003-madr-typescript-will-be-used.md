# TypeScript will be used for development

## Context and problem statement

As a web development project, the main choice was between JavaScript and
TypeScript. Both React and Next.js support both languages, but some libraries
still lack complete TypeScript documentation. Strong typing is important for
writing high-quality code, so the project must balance ecosystem support with
code safety.

## Decision and justification

The decision is to use TypeScript for development.

TypeScript was chosen because strong typing and linting capabilities are
essential for maintainable, high-quality code. While there may be complications
with some libraries lacking TypeScript documentation or types, the benefits of
type safety, better tooling, and early error detection outweigh these
drawbacks.

## Other options considered

- JavaScript: Considered for its simplicity and universal support, but lacks
  strong typing and static analysis features.
