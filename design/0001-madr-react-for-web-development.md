# React for web development

## Context and problem statement

For web development, selecting a widely adopted and well-supported framework is
crucial for long-term maintainability and integration with other technologies.

The project aims to leverage a robust ecosystem and ensure compatibility with
future tools and libraries.

React is currently the most popular framework for building modern web
applications.

## Decision and justification

The decision is to use React as the primary framework for web development.

React was chosen due to its popularity, extensive community support, and the
large number of libraries and frameworks that build on top of it.

This ensures that the project will be compatible with a wide range of
technologies and can easily incorporate new tools as they emerge.

React's component-based architecture also aligns well with modern development
practices and facilitates maintainable, scalable code.

## Other options considered

Angular: Considered as an alternative due to its comprehensive feature set and
enterprise adoption.

However, React was chosen because it remains the most popular frontend
framework according to the [2024 State of JS
survey](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/), which indicates stronger
community support and ecosystem longevity.
