# Use Lucide for iconography

## Context and problem statement

To improve the look and feel of the site, a selection of icons is needed.
The icon library should integrate well with React and provide a large variety
of icons covering different topics, not just UI elements.

## Decision and justification

The decision is to use Lucide for iconography throughout the site.

Lucide integrates well with React and offers a large number of icons across
many topics, making it suitable for both UI elements and general icon needs.
This flexibility allows for consistent and visually appealing icon usage
across the site, supporting both interface and content requirements.

## Other options considered

- Google Material Symbols: Provides many icons, but is primarily focused on UI
  elements and commerce, lacking a broader selection of general icons.
