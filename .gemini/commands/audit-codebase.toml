- Review the software architecture and design patterns used in the codebase.
  Identify any areas where the design could be improved for better
  maintainability, scalability, or performance.
- Analyze the tests:
  - Ensure that all test steps have appropriate assertions to validate the
    expected outcomes and that they are testing the intended functionality
    effectively. Ensure that their name reflects the functionality being tested.
  - Ensure that all steps are used by at least one test. If there are any steps
    that are not used by any tests, identify them and suggest whether they
    should be removed or if additional tests should be created to utilize them.
  - Review the test coverage to ensure that all critical paths and edge cases are
    adequately tested. Identify any gaps in test coverage and suggest areas
    where additional tests should be added.
- Based on your findings from the above steps, make any necessary improvements
  to the GEMINI.md file to ensure that the codebase will be well-maintained and
  adhere to best practices in the future.
