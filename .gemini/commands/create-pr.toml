- Ensure that the current branch is up to date with the main branch, and rebase
  if necessary.
- If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them before proceeding.
- Push the current branch to the remote repository if necessary.
- Use gh cli to create a pull request for the current branch.
- The PR title should be a short summary of the primary change or feature being
  introduced.
- The PR description should provide a detailed explanation of the changes made,
  including any relevant context.
- When using the gh cli, use a temporary file for the PR body (e.g., `gh pr
  create --body-file /tmp/pr_body.txt`) to avoid shell escaping issues and
  misinterpretation of special characters or command-like strings. Make sure to
  place the temporary file in the system's temporary directory so that it does
  not accidentally get committed to the repository.
